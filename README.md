# UFO-Sightings
## Overview of the analysis:
  - The purpose of this analysis is to have a deeper analysis of UFO sighting by allowing the searcher to filter by date, city, state, country and shape.
## Results:
  - If someone wants to search by City, take "benton" as an example:

  - If someone wants to search by State, take "ar" as an example:

  - If someone wants to search by Shape, take "circle" as an example:

  - If someone wants to search my mutiple criterias, take "1/4/2010", "ca", "light" as an example:

## Summary:
  - One drawback of this new design is that: there is no need to filter by country since there is only one country "us".
  - One recommendation for further development is to create another block that allowing the searcher to filter by duration.
  - Another recommendation is to add some filter buttons to beautify.
